Hello new developer, my name is Cyril Frébel and I hope that you love my idea, if you don't know this one,
that is simply the idea to develop an open source game engine, community developed and coded with python (pyOpenGL, tkinter, ...).

You have something to know before starting to modify the script of the game engine:

- you are not an employee so you are not going make money, you are a volunteer

- you can't write swear words, insults,... in the script

- if you want to use the script, please contribue to the developement

- please follow the instructions of "to do.txt"

- you give name that you want to your version

- when you made something, please inform me at the e-mail adress (in the bottom of the page) like that 
  I add this to the main version and remove it from "to do.txt"

- you have no right to the version that you developed

- you accept that we write your name in the list of contributors and us this list on our website and other utilisations (just fro constrbutors
  presentation)

- you are responsible if there is a problem with the software

- the versions that you sent us are saved and whe have the autorization to take parts of your code without your authorization (in this case,
  your name will be in the contributors list)

publication:
May 10, 2020 but don't worry, when the project will be released you can still contribute to its development

team:
you can join our facebook group called "tea_m" (I know that is not really funny but that was my only idea)
